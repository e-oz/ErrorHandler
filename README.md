Module for handling errors and uncaught exceptions (*ErrorHandler*), logging them in memory-storage (*ErrorLogger*) and notice admin about them (*MessageSender*).
Also, *Watcher* can watch points of your process (it's especially handy for long-running processes), control memory usage
and prevent unexpected process termination when memory limit is reached.
